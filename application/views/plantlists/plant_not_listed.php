    <h2>Why Can&#8217;t I Find My Plant?</h2>
  <p>The generally mild climate of the Pacific Northwest allows for a very diverse range of plants to be grown
      in this region.  There are potentially tens of thousands of different plants available to the gardening
      public from local and mail order nurseries.  If a plant you are looking for is not listed as a Great Plant Pick,
      it is for one of the following reasons:</p>
  <ul class="leaf">
      <li>If you are searching by plant name, check the spelling.</li>
      <li>If you are working from the Advanced Search page, you may have selected too many plant attributes at one time&#8212;try
          clicking on fewer check boxes.</li>
      <li>The plant has not yet been considered by the GPP selection committee.</li>
      <li>The plant does not meet the <a href="<?php echo base_url();?>about/criteria/">GPP Selection Criteria</a>.</li>
      <li>The plant is currently under evaluation by the GPP Selection Committee.</li>
  </ul>
