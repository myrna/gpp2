Jon TODO list:
----------------

If you have time -- I have the autocomplete function working after a fashion on the administrative search function -- right now
it is only looking at the "genus" and it lists duplicate fields (so if you type in "ab" you see a lot of abelia, acer, etc.).  Is
there a way to get the autocomplete_model to search on all parts of the full botanical name?  Barring that, to search each "important" name field and
not return duplicates -- I don't know if that's possible since they are all individual records.  And for the public function ideally it
would go for common names and synonyms as well.  Maybe it would be better to have the autocomplete function pull from a static page with
a list on it?  Don't know what is easiest....

Thanks!

Set up the plantlists/ page so that it has a “basic” search function (a single search box, as on the admin plant list page),
and then a list of preformatted plant search list links, something like http://www.greatplantpicks.org/search.php ,
along with a link to an “advanced search” function on a separate page. This basic search function needs to be able
to search through all parts of the full botanical name, the common name table, and the plant synonym table, and then
bring up results as shown on plantlists/display.

NOTES: This may still have some rough edges, it hasn't been completely tested, but should work

----

For views/plantlists/view need to add $category to the image id so that when page is loaded initial main image loaded will be "primary";
currently no initial main image is loaded, thumbnail needs to be clicked (I left javascript on the page for now in case that needs any
changes).  I loaded three images into the Acer saccharum 'Green Mountain' data so that is the plant I have been looking at to test this.
Note that I'm allowing space for a main image that is larger than the one currently loaded; Rick will be loading new and larger images.

NOTES: This *should* work now - have a look and see if this is what you wanted

----



For views/plantlists/view please look at what I've attempted to do for foliage color; if you can show how to display a list of colors
then I can probably use that as a template to get the rest of the data that comes out of linked tables that may have more than one
entry (ie flower color, wildlife, soil type, sun requirements...).

NOTES: Added foliage_color as an example - let me know if you need me to do the others

Limit public search function to published plants
