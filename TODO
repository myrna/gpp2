NEW ITEM (10-31-2011)

We need to set up pre-configured searches that will search two or three tables -- for example:

Search for plants where (1) plant type=perennial, (2) theme=foliage, (3) sun requirements=light shade

or

(1)theme = foliage, (2) foliage_color = blue

and, perhaps more complicated:

(1)common_name = azalea (this is from the plant_common_name table, not the family common name field in plant_data),
(2)foliage_type = evergreen

I  haven't been able to figure this out; the alternative (if this is easier) would be to set up a theme search field in the public "advanced
search" page, do the search so that it becomes a "saved search", and use that link for the pre-programmed search, then pull the theme option
off of the "advanced search" page.  I can do this, but I think the way you have set up pre-programmed searches is much cleaner.  However if
time-wise it is wiser to do it my quick-and-dirty way, at least for now, I can do that. I don't know that I can do this with the common_name/
foliage_type search, though.

12/30/11 addition:

On the "results" page -- for example, ...plantlists/by_texture/bold -- we list the family common name from the plant_data table.
Richie really wants this to list the individual common names from the plant_common_name table (as we do on the individual plant fact sheets).
 Please consider budget before tackling this -- if this is more than 1-2 hours and/or if the above task took
more than a couple of hours we should probably talk before tackling this. But, it's a pretty high priority for Richie.

Thanks!


IGNORE THESE FOR NOW...

______
Rick would also like a "previous record/next record" function so that from the "edit" page he can continue on his found list without
going back to the main list each time.  He'd also like to see this function on the public side; if you do a search and come up with a list,
and call up one plant on that list, he'd like the user to be able to walk forward or backward through that list without going back to
the "found" list.

======

Autocomplete....
If you have time -- I have the autocomplete function working after a fashion on the administrative search function -- right now
it is only looking at the "genus" and it lists duplicate fields //you fixed this, thank you!!! //(so if you type in "ab" you see a lot of abelia, acer, etc.).  Is
there a way to get the autocomplete_model to search on all parts of the full botanical name?  And for the public function ideally it
would go for common names and synonyms as well.  Maybe it would be better to have the autocomplete function pull from a static page with
a list on it?  Don't know what is easiest....

Addendum: autocomplete always starts at "a" no matter what is typed into the search box (ge brings up abelia, etc.)

Thanks!


================FINISHED==================

Found that the "back" problem is still there, but only in this situation: on the administrative side, if I do a search on the admin/listplants page and pull up a list (for example, all gpp plants); then edit
a record from that list, then hit the "back" button, I get a "do you want to resubmit this form" notice.  What we need is to be able
to go "back" to the found list, as in the public side.

Set up the plantlists/ page so that it has a “basic” search function (a single search box, as on the admin plant list page),
and then a list of preformatted plant search list links, something like http://www.greatplantpicks.org/search.php ,
along with a link to an “advanced search” function on a separate page. This basic search function needs to be able
to search through all parts of the full botanical name, the common name table, and the plant synonym table, and then
bring up results as shown on plantlists/display.

NOTES: This may still have some rough edges, it hasn't been completely tested, but should work

----

For views/plantlists/view need to add $category to the image id so that when page is loaded initial main image loaded will be "primary";
currently no initial main image is loaded, thumbnail needs to be clicked (I left javascript on the page for now in case that needs any
changes).  I loaded three images into the Acer saccharum 'Green Mountain' data so that is the plant I have been looking at to test this.
Note that I'm allowing space for a main image that is larger than the one currently loaded; Rick will be loading new and larger images.

NOTES: This *should* work now - have a look and see if this is what you wanted
Yes, thanks -- working great!

----



For views/plantlists/view please look at what I've attempted to do for foliage color; if you can show how to display a list of colors
then I can probably use that as a template to get the rest of the data that comes out of linked tables that may have more than one
entry (ie flower color, wildlife, soil type, sun requirements...).

NOTES: Added foliage_color as an example - let me know if you need me to do the others

Limit public search function to published plants

-----

When tackling the "advanced search" function -- if each search result can have its own URI (my model for this is 
http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/codeigniter-from-scratch-search-results-without-query-strings-2/)
then I can use these search results to make links for the pre-programmed searches.  What do you think?  The
main impetus behind getting URIs for search results is that I can set up an email function where the user can
email the "current page URI" to him/herself or somebody else (this is my substitute, for now, for allowing people
to log in, create accounts and save lists).  We want people to be able to search by the following fields -- 

plant name (current search does this)

from plant_data table
plant_type (shrub, tree, etc.)
foliage_type (evergreen, deciduous, semi)
plant_height_max (giving a range --
plant_width_max --not sure if these two are going to work...)
growth_habit
flower_time

from linked tables
foliage_color (probably can only let them pick one?)
sun
water
soil

------

the pre-programmed searches not covered by the above would be for (both from plant_data table) -- these need to be clickable
links leading to the search results; they will be placed on the plantlists/search/ page (click on "Plant Lists"):

GPPs by year (gpp_year)
GPP by theme (theme)
Others-- as on current site -- such as small trees (which would be a search for "tree" and "less than" --
need to get figure from Rick)
