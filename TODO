Jon TODO list:
----------------
Jon, looks like you have fixed this?  I'm not seeing the "resubmit form" problem any more.

Addendum (possible solution to "back" button problem) found this on a CodeIgniter forum (but requires query strings for
all search results, including admin, to avoid the back button problem):
http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/177436/#841275


======

"Back" to search/found list from individual plant view; need to figure out how to accomplish this (both by browser "back" button and by
a "back to previous list" button on the page) without being asked if we want to resubmit form data.  I suspect this can be accomplished
if we are able to create a query string in the URI, then we can direct back via that; or by using sessions, but since ultimately
we want the query string that might be better?  I have been trying to do this with the admin plant list and edit pages (Rick requested
this feature) and am still struggling with it... need the feature in both admin and public plant searches.

======

If you have time -- I have the autocomplete function working after a fashion on the administrative search function -- right now
it is only looking at the "genus" and it lists duplicate fields //you fixed this, thank you!!! //(so if you type in "ab" you see a lot of abelia, acer, etc.).  Is
there a way to get the autocomplete_model to search on all parts of the full botanical name?  Barring that, to search each "important" name field and
not return duplicates -- I don't know if that's possible since they are all individual records.  And for the public function ideally it
would go for common names and synonyms as well.  Maybe it would be better to have the autocomplete function pull from a static page with
a list on it?  Don't know what is easiest....

Addendum: autocomplete always starts at "a" no matter what is typed into the search box (ge brings up abelia, etc.)

Thanks!

================FINISHED==================

Set up the plantlists/ page so that it has a “basic” search function (a single search box, as on the admin plant list page),
and then a list of preformatted plant search list links, something like http://www.greatplantpicks.org/search.php ,
along with a link to an “advanced search” function on a separate page. This basic search function needs to be able
to search through all parts of the full botanical name, the common name table, and the plant synonym table, and then
bring up results as shown on plantlists/display.

NOTES: This may still have some rough edges, it hasn't been completely tested, but should work

----

For views/plantlists/view need to add $category to the image id so that when page is loaded initial main image loaded will be "primary";
currently no initial main image is loaded, thumbnail needs to be clicked (I left javascript on the page for now in case that needs any
changes).  I loaded three images into the Acer saccharum 'Green Mountain' data so that is the plant I have been looking at to test this.
Note that I'm allowing space for a main image that is larger than the one currently loaded; Rick will be loading new and larger images.

NOTES: This *should* work now - have a look and see if this is what you wanted
Yes, thanks -- working great!

----



For views/plantlists/view please look at what I've attempted to do for foliage color; if you can show how to display a list of colors
then I can probably use that as a template to get the rest of the data that comes out of linked tables that may have more than one
entry (ie flower color, wildlife, soil type, sun requirements...).

NOTES: Added foliage_color as an example - let me know if you need me to do the others

Limit public search function to published plants

-----

When tackling the "advanced search" function -- if each search result can have its own URI (my model for this is 
http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/codeigniter-from-scratch-search-results-without-query-strings-2/)
then I can use these search results to make links for the pre-programmed searches.  What do you think?  The
main impetus behind getting URIs for search results is that I can set up an email function where the user can
email the "current page URI" to him/herself or somebody else (this is my substitute, for now, for allowing people
to log in, create accounts and save lists).  We want people to be able to search by the following fields -- 

plant name (current search does this)

from plant_data table
plant_type (shrub, tree, etc.)
foliage_type (evergreen, deciduous, semi)
plant_height_max (giving a range --
plant_width_max --not sure if these two are going to work...)
growth_habit
flower_time

from linked tables
foliage_color (probably can only let them pick one?)
sun
water
soil

------

the pre-programmed searches not covered by the above would be for (both from plant_data table) -- these need to be clickable
links leading to the search results; they will be placed on the plantlists/search/ page (click on "Plant Lists"):

GPPs by year (gpp_year)
GPP by theme (theme)
Others-- as on current site -- such as small trees (which would be a search for "tree" and "less than" --
need to get figure from Rick)
