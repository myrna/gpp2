Jon TODO list:
----------------

Set up the plantlists/ page so that it has a “basic” search function (a single search box, as on the admin plant list page),
and then a list of preformatted plant search list links, something like http://www.greatplantpicks.org/search.php ,
along with a link to an “advanced search” function on a separate page. This basic search function needs to be able
to search through all parts of the full botanical name, the common name table, and the plant synonym table, and then
bring up results as shown on plantlists/display.

For views/plantlists/view need to add $category to the image id so that when page is loaded initial main image loaded will be "primary";
currently no initial main image is loaded, thumbnail needs to be clicked (I left javascript on the page for now in case that needs any
changes).  I loaded three images into the Acer saccharum 'Green Mountain' data so that is the plant I have been looking at to test this.
Note that I'm allowing space for a main image that is larger than the one currently loaded; Rick will be loading new and larger images.
