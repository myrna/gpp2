Jon TODO list:
----------------

Set up the plantlists/ page so that it has a “basic” search function (a single search box, as on the admin plant list page),
and then a list of preformatted plant search list links, something like http://www.greatplantpicks.org/search.php ,
along with a link to an “advanced search” function on a separate page. This basic search function needs to be able
to search through all parts of the full botanical name, the common name table, and the plant synonym table, and then
bring up results as shown on plantlists/display.
