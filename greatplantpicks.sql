Plant Patent 16,988.This new Glossy Abelia is such an improvement over older varieties! It was bred for color stability and compact habit, and these it has in trumps -- the variegation is true all season long and beautifully defined, while the plant itself remains small (2 to 3 feet tall and slightly wider), well-branched, and nicely leafed out. But it''s also the longest-blooming Abelia by far, and its winter leaf retention is first-rate. The leaves emerge along bright red stems, each with a lime-green center and bright yellow edges. As spring turns to summer, the yellow matures to golden, but it''s still clearly demarcated from the green. This is one variegated Abelia that absolutely won''t scorch or burn, even in the hottest weather! And as if this weren''t color enough, by late spring the entire shrub is covered with soft pink buds, which open to white blooms. These flowers persist well into autumn, even remaining as the foliage begins turning bright shades of golden, orange, and red. This is a magnificent effect, and really makes ''Kaleidoscope'' stand out. And even in winter, ''Kaleidoscope'' continues its show, sporting excellent leaf retention. A sport of A. ''Little Richard,'' ''Kaleidoscope'' was selected in 1997 by Randy Lindsey of North Carolina. After years of trialing, it was released in 2006. It thrives in full sun to part shade and in any well-drained soil, including sandy coastal types (it is not bothered by salt spray).

As Victor began downsizing his nursery, Art was persuaded to take the Civil Service Gardener''s Examination, following which he returned to Golden Gate Park in 1953 and to the Park''s Arboretum sometime thereafter. He served as Plant Accessions Supervisor under Strybing Director Percy ""Jock"" Brydon (who was director from 1960-1969) and Roy Hudson (director from 1969-1971). Director John Bryan (1971-1979) implemented the necessary administrative process to win for Art the title of Assistant Director, which he held until his untimely death. Arthur Menzies was a great man in his own right. He was Assistant Director of our garden until his death in 1973. I quote an excerpt from the memorial article written in our newsletter: ""...a walking encyclopedia of flora and fauna...[h]e was known in horticultural circles throughout the world for his expertise, as is evidenced by his global correspondence and exchange of seed and plant material."" Our award-winning native garden, the Arthur L. Menzies Memorial Garden of Native Plants, was named in his honor. In the 1970s some 13 of a possible 14 species of Mahonia were recorded as being on view in the Native Garden.If you are interested in further information about Art Menzies and the memorial garden, I recommend two articles in California Horticultural Journal, v.36, no.2 (April 1975), p.54-62.

Its dark stems can be emphasized by removing the side shoots and leaves along each culm, up to about four feet from the ground. When planted in open areas, dig a one-foot-wide and one-foot-deep trench around the planting hole and fill it with sand. This makes it easier to remove roaming rhizomes. In dry situations, black bamboo spreads less, but the culms are shorter and thinner. For container growing, select a planter at least 3 feet in diameter, keep the plant well watered and fertilized. Every few years it can be popped it out of the pot and cut into divisions with a  Swede/bow saw or a rip saw.

This evergreen''s slow growth and refined habit make it an excellent choice for the urban landscape. Pieris are a favorite and important food source for our native pollinator, the mason bee. Play off the delicate, evergreen foliage of lily-of-the-valley shrub with coarser plants, such as rhododendrons, or other bolder, variegated plants. Ferns, hostas and epimediums also thrive in the company of these beautiful shrubs. Pieris ''Brouwer''s Beauty'' is an unusual hybrid between Pieris floribunda, from eastern North America, and Pieris japonica, from Japan.

In addition, you''ll help to ensure that this characteristic and picturesque oak remains part of our landscapes for generations to come. Only about 5 percent of the true native Garry oak ecosystem remains in B.C., Washington and Oregon, so thinking of Garry oaks may get you thinking of other native and native-compatible plantings. Also called Oregon white oak, it thrives from Victoria to central California. It is particularly well adapted to the warmer, drier parts of the region, where it grows into a large tree. In wetter parts of our region, such as Vancouver, this tree tends to sulk, growing very slowly. The best approach is to create a large bed for this tree and its companions. This could replace lawn, making a more naturalistic tableau of grasses, bulbs and other easy-care perennials and shrubs. Camas (both Camassia quamash and C. leichtlinii), fawn lily (Erythronium oregonum), and harvest brodiaea (Brodiaea coronaria) are natural companions.

Suitable companion shrubs include flowering currant, evergreen huckleberry and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus).

Plan on allowing these lower branches to create a wide skirt around the tree. When young, it also has the tendency of many oaks to retain foliage through winter. Once a branch becomes reproductively mature, producing acorns, it also drops is autumn leaves cleanly. Shade encourages this juvenile habit, so full sun is important. Pin oak thrives in fertile, well-drained, acidic soil, but it tolerates a wide range of soils: poorly drained, damp, clay, compacted, and dry. (The epithet ''palustris'' means ''marsh-loving''.)

From a distance, pin oak''s silhouette is pleasing, both in winter, when its smooth, grey-brown bark is revealed, and in summer with its deeply cut, pointed, dark green leaves. Eventually it develops a more rounded crown, but this may take many decades. Unlike many other plants, pin oak tolerates a wide range of soil conditions, meaning that it will thrive where many other trees perish. It produces small, squat acorns and its autumn leaves change to bright red then bronze-brown. The fall color appears to last a long time because the leaf-color change is so gradual.

A ten-year height is about 15 feet by 6 feet.', 'Sorbus ''Joseph Rock'' requires well-drained soil and moisture in summer.  It is native to places that have summer rain, so in our region supplemental water in summer is important.  A neutral to slightly acidic, well-drained, loamy soil is best for this plant.  Full sun and good air circulation are also important.  Sorbus ''Joseph Rock'' is a good lawn specimen because it can tolerate the lime applied to the lawn. This tree can be short lived if it is planted in poor conditions. Unless there are problems, it is best not to prune this naturally graceful tree. If it has dead, damaged or crossing branches, remove them only in the dead of winter on a dry day or in summer (late July to early August), pruning as little as possible. The only disease problem of ''Joseph Rock'' is one that afflicts other rose family members: fireblight. This occurs when warm spring weather occurs in conjunction with heavy rains. The disease is not common in Portland but is more common in Vancouver. The symptoms of this bacterial disease, which enters the plant through its flowers, include tip dieback and blackening of twigs. If it shows symptoms of fireblight, wait for a dry, sunny, spring day and cut out the affected areas, disinfect your pruners between each cut. Do not prune it in wet weather! Fireblight also affects other rose-family plants, such as Cotoneasters, Pyracantha, and hawthorn, so you may already know if it is a problem in your garden. If so, avoid Sorbus.', 'The look of Sorbus ''Joseph Rock'' is as dreamy as its origin - as a seed collected by plant collector Joseph Rock (1884 to 1962) in Yundshi Mountain, in northwestern Yunnan, China, in 1932. In the fall, when its branches hand with butterscotch-colored fruits in large clusters, it takes your breath away. In summer its blue-green leaves, composed of up to 21 leaflets, and upright habit of growth are also highly ornamental. Leaves turn to burnt sienna and then deep red in fall. In spring it produces 4-inch clusters of white flowers. Unlike other species of Sorbus, such as S. aucuparia, ''Joseph Rock'' does not appear to seed in the landscape. Some botanists feel that ''Joseph Rock'' is a variant of Sorbus rehderiana.
