Plant Patent 16,988.This new Glossy Abelia is such an improvement over older varieties! It was bred for color stability and compact habit, and these it has in trumps -- the variegation is true all season long and beautifully defined, while the plant itself remains small (2 to 3 feet tall and slightly wider), well-branched, and nicely leafed out. But it''s also the longest-blooming Abelia by far, and its winter leaf retention is first-rate. The leaves emerge along bright red stems, each with a lime-green center and bright yellow edges. As spring turns to summer, the yellow matures to golden, but it''s still clearly demarcated from the green. This is one variegated Abelia that absolutely won''t scorch or burn, even in the hottest weather! And as if this weren''t color enough, by late spring the entire shrub is covered with soft pink buds, which open to white blooms. These flowers persist well into autumn, even remaining as the foliage begins turning bright shades of golden, orange, and red. This is a magnificent effect, and really makes ''Kaleidoscope'' stand out. And even in winter, ''Kaleidoscope'' continues its show, sporting excellent leaf retention. A sport of A. ''Little Richard,'' ''Kaleidoscope'' was selected in 1997 by Randy Lindsey of North Carolina. After years of trialing, it was released in 2006.

It is best pruned in winter, but pruning any time after the spring flush of growth is fine. It can be hand pruned to encourage the pyramidal growth habit or sheared for a large hedge or topiary. It grows best in full sun. In part shade it is more prone to leaf spot diseases. To renovate a large, overgrown holly hedge, cut it back in February or March. It will quickly resprout from old wood. ', 'Hedgehog holly has very curious leaves. They are variegated with white and, in addition to marginal spines, they bear a pincushion of spines on their upper leaf surfaces as well. This clone is male, meaning that it cannot produce berries and become a nuisance in wild places. (The red spheres that show in this November photo are the dormant flower buds.) Hedgehog holly is most available in late fall and winter, as it is often sold for planting in winter containers, where it looks especially fine. This shrub-that-wants-to-be-a-tree can be planted in a group, for screening or as a barrier plant, or used alone as a focal point. It can also be used as a hedge. Emphasize the winter interest of hedgehog holly by combining it with yellow-stemmed dogwood, witchhazel and masses of Christmas rose. Hedgehog holly''s evergreen leaves are decorative year ''round.

From the beginning this clone looked different from its siblings. After the very cold winter of 1962, it alone survived. Its relative hardiness indicated that it was a hybrid, most likely of M. bealei. It was named by Washington Park Arboretum curator Brian Mulligan for his colleague Arthur Menzies (1916 to 1973).

In 1947, he left to catalog rock garden plants for noted Bay Area horticulturist Victor Rieter. As Victor began downsizing his nursery, Art was persuaded to take the Civil Service Gardener''s Examination, following which he returned to Golden Gate Park in 1953 and to the Park''s Arboretum sometime thereafter.

Director John Bryan (1971-1979) implemented the necessary administrative process to win for Art the title of Assistant Director, which he held until his untimely death. Arthur Menzies was a great man in his own right.

Its dark stems can be emphasized by removing the side shoots and leaves along each culm, up to about four feet from the ground. When planted in open areas, dig a one-foot-wide and one-foot-deep trench around the planting hole and fill it with sand. This makes it easier to remove roaming rhizomes. In dry situations, black bamboo spreads less, but the culms are shorter and thinner. For container growing, select a planter at least 3 feet in diameter, keep the plant well watered and fertilized. Every few years it can be popped it out of the pot and cut into divisions with a  Swede/bow saw or a rip saw.

On any type of tree, branches with a narrow angle to the trunk have a weaker attachment that those with a wide angle. To prevent snow damage in years to come on your tanyosho pine, prune away branches that are very tight to the trunk and leave those that form wider angles. The overall goal is to open the crown of the tree out a bit and make the remaining branches a sturdy as possible. Tanyosho pine is relatively pest free. Occasionally pine shoot moth can infect the new growth. This can easily be remedied by the timely removal of any wilting or dying shoots in spring. ', 'The influence of Japanese gardening permeates the Northwest landscape, and few plants invoke this Asian style as well as tanyosho pine. Nothing else has its unique growth habit and such a wonderful combination of ornamental attributes. It grows slowly into a flat-topped tree, hence the name tabletop pine. Each branch radiates out in a vase-like pattern from its strong main trunk. Bright green needles are very thin and soft to the touch, they are held aristocratically at the ends of its branches. Bark on the trunk and main braches flakes and peels to reveal a rusty, orange-red inner layer that provides a counterpoint to tanyosho pine''s green needles. Use this pine as a specimen in the garden. Mature tanyosho pines can be underplanted with rhododendrons or low-growing cultivars of Japanese maple. Plants with deep green foliage complement the color of this pine''s beautiful bark. ', '', 'Hartlage', '2005', 'trees - conifers', '', '', '', 'GPP', '', '', '2006', 'small-tree ', '', 'Yes', ''),

In addition, you''ll help to ensure that this characteristic and picturesque oak remains part of our landscapes for generations to come. Only about 5 percent of the true native Garry oak ecosystem remains in B.C., Washington and Oregon, so thinking of Garry oaks may get you thinking of other native and native-compatible plantings. Also called Oregon white oak, it thrives from Victoria to central California. It is particularly well adapted to the warmer, drier parts of the region, where it grows into a large tree. In wetter parts of our region, such as Vancouver, this tree tends to sulk, growing very slowly. The best approach is to create a large bed for this tree and its companions. This could replace lawn, making a more naturalistic tableau of grasses, bulbs and other easy-care perennials and shrubs. Camas (both Camassia quamash and C. leichtlinii), fawn lily (Erythronium oregonum), and harvest brodiaea (Brodiaea coronaria) are natural companions. They bloom in spring and become dormant when spring rains vanish. Allow them to seed and increase naturally. Suitable companion shrubs include flowering currant, evergreen huckleberry and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus). Ornamental grasses, such as Festuca, Helictotrichon, and Molinia, while not all native, would help to provide summer interest. The main thing is to choose companions that also like sharp drainage and are drought tolerant, so that you don''t have to water heavily in summer.
